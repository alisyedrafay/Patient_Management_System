Patient Management System – FastAPI

This project is a Patient Management System backend API developed using FastAPI and Python. The system is designed to handle patient-related data efficiently through well-structured RESTful endpoints. It focuses on simplicity, clarity, and scalability, making it suitable for learning, academic projects, and backend portfolio use.

The application allows users to perform complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on patient records. Each endpoint follows REST API best practices and ensures proper request handling and response formatting.

The project also includes data validation to ensure that incorrect or invalid input does not break the system. FastAPI’s built-in validation features are used to maintain clean and reliable data flow across the application.

An additional feature of this system is patient data sorting, which allows patient records to be retrieved in an ordered manner based on specific attributes such as name or age. This makes data handling more practical and closer to real-world backend systems.

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI, making it easy to test and understand all endpoints without needing any external tools. This improves developer experience and makes the project beginner-friendly.

This system is ideal for:

Learning FastAPI and REST API development

Understanding backend workflows

Practicing CRUD operations

Building a backend-focused portfolio project

Demonstrating API design skills for freelancing or internships

Overall, the Patient Management System showcases a clean, minimal, and practical backend implementation using modern Python frameworks, following industry-standard API development practices.
